    - Manipulate the $user object to the username of oracle account
    - Manipulate the $pass object to the password of the oracle account
    - Manipulate the $dbHost object to the path of server
7. Place the OceanObservationSystem folder in the path /compsci/webdocs/(username)/web_docs/OceanObservationSystem

8. Follow the setup of IDE and connect to the databases in the IDE's services
9. Go to the url of the server, http://consort.cs.ualberta.ca/~(username)/OceanObservationSystem./
    - In our case, it is available at http://consort.cs.ualberta.ca/~sjpartri/cmput_project/OceanObservationSystem./loginScreen.php
